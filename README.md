## SimpleCalculator

- I've made a simple calculator with basic functionality in expo (react-native) 
- It contaons the functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and clear screen!
- it have input and output text boxes that take texts from the buttons and use that values as the input for the calculation
- usestates are used for these types of functionality
- styles are also applied to the  app 
- it is in responsive behaviour and will work (hopefully) on all types of devices.
- the code is easy to understand and you can clone it and make changes to anything you want!
- Happy Coding :)
